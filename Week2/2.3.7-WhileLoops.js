// Create a while loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100 by following these steps...

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let currNum = 100;

// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let currTotal = 0;

// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
i = 1;
while (i <= currNum) {
  currTotal += i;
  i++;
}
